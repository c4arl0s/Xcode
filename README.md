The Xcode workspace is divided into five main sections.

# 2. [Xcode file types]()

Xcode knows how to work with a variety of files that span across multiple programming languages. For now, you will learn about files related to projects written in the Swift language.

At the very top of the project navigator, you will see a file with a tiny blue Xcode icon. Click the file to open it in the editor area. This is the `.xcodeproj` file, which includes all the settings for your project and its targets. Each target is a product that Xcode can build from the project. For now the targets you will build will be executable apps. Later, you may use targets to build frameworks, different versions of a particular app, or versions for different platforms like watchOS or tvOS.
