The Xcode workspace is divided into five main sections.

# 2. [Xcode file types](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Xcode#xcode---content)

Xcode knows how to work with a variety of files that span across multiple programming languages. For now, you will learn about files related to projects written in the Swift language.

At the very top of the project navigator, you will see a file with a tiny blue Xcode icon. Click the file to open it in the editor area. This is the `.xcodeproj` file, which includes all the settings for your project and its targets. **Each target is a product that Xcode can build from the project**. For now the targets you will build will be executable apps. Later, you may use targets to build frameworks, different versions of a particular app, or versions for different platforms like watchOS or tvOS.

# 3. [Keyboard Shorcuts](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Xcode#xcode---content)

As you become more proficient with Xcode, you will discover that it is much faster to execute tasks using keyboard shortcuts. Make sure to learn the most common shortcuts right away:

1. Command-B - Build the project.
2. Command-R - Build and run the project.
3. Command-/ - Toggle comments on selected rows of code.
4. Command-\[ - Shift the selected code left [command - option - \[)

# 4. [Xcode Preferences](https://github.com/c4arl0s/Xcode#xcode---content)

Xcode is a powerful tool with many options. As you work with Xcode you will learn more about what it can do and how you can customize it to work how you want it to. Check out the Xcode Preferences by navigating to Xcode -> Preferences in the menu bar. You can use the Preferences to add developer accounts, customize navigation or fonts, or choose certain behaviors when text editing and more.

Open up the Xcode Preferences and navigate to the Fonts & Colors menu.

You can choose a new theme, or set of colors and fonts, by selecting different options in the list on the left. The Civic theme is great if you prefer a dark editing mode, and the Presentation or Presentation Large options are perfect when presenting code to a group.

You can read much more about Xcode and its various tools in the Xcode Help Documentation, which you can open in Xcode by choosing help -> Xcode help in the menu bar.
